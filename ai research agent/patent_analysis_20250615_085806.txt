Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to predict future innovations in lithium battery technology based on patent trends for the next 2-3 years. Here's how I plan to approach this:

1. **Identify Technologies Likely to See Breakthroughs**: 
   - I'll focus on recent advancements in materials science, manufacturing processes, energy efficiency, and sustainability.
   - Tools like search_patents will help me find patents related to these areas.

2. **Prioritize R&D Investment Areas**:
   - After identifying technologies, I'll categorize them into key R&D investment areas based on their impact or number of publications.

3. **Identify Companies Leading Innovation**:
   - I'll note down companies that are prominent in each technology area and assign them to specific R&D investment areas.

4. **Predict Potential Disruptive Technologies**:
   - I'll look for technologies that have the potential to disrupt current market trends, such as new materials or energy storage solutions.

5. **Timeline of Technical Improvements**:
   - For each technology, I'll outline the expected timeline for technical improvements based on patent data.

6. **Justification for All Predictions**:
   - I'll provide a brief justification for each prediction using relevant patent data to back up my claims.

By following this structured approach, I can create a comprehensive forecast that aligns with the user's requirements.
